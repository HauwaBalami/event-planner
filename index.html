        <span>“Working with Michelle|WeDesign to repurpose a spare bedroom in my home to a useful office and guest bedroom was a no brainer!&nbsp; She helped to bring form &amp; function together with ease for harmony and joy when I walk into my new office!&nbsp; Such a seamless experience and transformation.&nbsp; We started out working virtually then in-home.&nbsp; She made the entire process go smoothly and her shopping for new additions as well as using some of my own things was on target and within budget.&nbsp; Great color advice as well.&nbsp; Try her out!” ~&nbsp; Anne</span>
